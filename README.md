- 👋 Hi, I’m @Klangen82 aka Martin or the oposit:wink:
- 👀 I’m interested in home automations and love [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), where I use it for eveything. To give you an idea what I have set up over the years here is a small list:
  - I have solar panels
  - battery to store and sell energy
  - EV
  - all my lights are smart
  - bed sensors so I don't need to turn off my lights
  - automatical locks so I don't need a key in my life
  - atomatical blinds
  - google home in all rooms
  - homemade ambient lights on television
  - homemade electric monitering systems both P1/HAN port and clamps on diffrent loads
  - cameras all over the place running AI analytic and face rec and propbly I have missed somethings but as you see I like to play around with things.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning life, will have a sabbatical half year first of March.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can, as I'm not a programers it's hard for me to help. But often I have somewhat a good idea so if you need to get an diffrent aspect on a problem then I maybe can help:smile:
- 📫 How to reach me would be just send me a DM here
